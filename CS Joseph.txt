---------------------------------------------------------
If you're an introvert and you're extroverting, it means you've turned into your subconscious/unconscious personality.

---------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------
F and T are on the same axis, so are N and S. also, if one is introverted the other is extroverted. (if you have Ti you surely have Fe)
----------- decision making functions (4)
	Status, Morals and Feelings
Te: rationale.
 Rational thinking: collective true or false. decisions based on data and statistics, votes, references. they decide based off the majority, so if there are 10 tables and 6 of them rule true (the majority) Te user will believe the decision to be true. but they actually make decisions based on what people around them think is true. thought vampires. they surround themselves with smart thinkers so they feel smart. read books and have mentors all the time. project other people's thoughts. group think. value credentials and titles. avoid making them embarrassed and humiliated (it will make them feel bad). 

they think the opinions of people without credentials don't matter. it's all about validity.
 they need books. in social situations want others to think well of them. always wants to look good, make them look bad and they'll hate you, and maybe leave the group. they love status and being in the spotlight.

Fi: Morals.
 moral decision making. it's all about good or bad. the true source of social interaction is Fi user. they wanna have fame

"Te and Fi are on the same axis." if you have one you have the other, if I have one of them in the 1st slot I have the other in the 4th, or if I have on in the 2nd the other is in the 3rd.
they're all very status driven. 
If you have Fi/Te you know how you feel about sth and ask others how do you think about this, if you have Fe/Ti you know how you think about sth and ask others how they feel about it.
so Fi users become the moral compass of the Fe users. 
-------------- 
	Truth
Fe: ethics.
 It allows to feel the feeling of others. the users are very caring. wants to make Fi user feel good. they're supportive. makes people feel guilt. If you wanna make a Fe user feel guilty let them know they "made you feel bad". to make them feel better show them gratitude and recognition and value what they do.
 having Fe as hero or parent makes a person self sacrificing, and they could be taken advantage of, but don't take advantage and piss them off cuz they'll cut you off and get back at you. they have pride issues and struggle with covert contracts, they wanna be felt special, specially in front of other people.

Ti: logic.
 logical thinking. I know the truth and that's all that matters, it doesn't matter how others feel about it and their credentials are irrelevant. 
 truth is undeniable, it doesn't matter how anyone feels about it, and people should deal with it and grow up and improve themselves.(Ti user wants others to improve cuz cares about them through Fe)

 ad hominem happens because of Fe, someone makes a point with their Ti but gets an emotional response from the Fe user.
-------------- perception functions (4) 
	Forward Perceiving
Se: [Wind] living in the moment, physics, mechanical awareness, short term memory, forgetful. always aware of what other people are doing. they want to give other people an experience. they react faster to things.
they're all about "what is", not "what if", unless they're thinking "what if it happens to me". Se requires freedom. an Se user thinks if they don't react to sth now they're gonna forget later so they'll react to negative stuff instantly and with full rage. they want your ful attention, so if you reply to texts fast they'll feel the energy and your presence, but might not even read old texts cuz they've lost energy and are not valid anymore.
if they're high in Se they wanna know what you're doing all the time. best way to defeat them is overwhelm them with options and possible futures.(with Ne)

Ni: [Fire] predicting one's own path. "what I want to do", "What I intend", "my goal/path". it's very future based. allows them to stay focused. brings them "luck". they try to optimize their success by finding the best path forward. (a singular path). it's movement oriented, it's going places. give them choices.
the less Ni you have, the more you are duty based, like Si users. 

-------------- 
Ne: [Water] The collective unconscious.
 metaphysical awareness (the opposite of physics). 
 high Se users will think high Ne users are retarded. it's concerned about possibilities. it's awareness of what other people want and their desires (and manipulate desires), and what they're about to do. enables one to predict things before they happen. it's not based off decisions and statistics and mathematics, it's based on what you see.
 (there's a saying: if you observe a possibility, you are more likely to make it come true.) you can make decisions to make probabilities happen. 
 to stop them from manipulating you make them uncomfortable (with Se) and they'll have to recalculate everything

Si: [Earth] one's awareness of longterm memory. gives one their sense of duty and need for honor (Si+Fe), stability, comfort, being past focused, can bring up stuff that have happened in the past. they're very loyal. don't push a loyal person to the point of not giving a damn cuz they'll stop and back stab you.(to avoid that, make them comfortable when necessary, listen to their anecdotes, listen to their stories or tell em u already told me this.) they're very patient. they like it when Se users show them things. they love being on the bottom. they're traditional especially if Si+Fe.

(all that has happened before will happen again. or, history repeats itself.)

Se users are likely to get Alzheimer's while Si users are more likely to get dementia. 

if Ne users force themselves to get more experience they'll increase their ability to see into the future. they see more patterns.
---------------------------------------------------------
since the functions are all in axes with each other, if you only know the hero and parent function you can guess the rest.
---------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------

Ego:

Hero: your super power. has collateral damage.
Parent: is very responsible. protects child from hero's collateral damage.
Child: the most innocent part of soul. attacking it is child abuse.
Inferior: where a person's fear and insecurity exists. If you're not careful with others' inferior function they might instantly hate you. if it's all good with these, you'll be able to use subconscious, but if pushed you will get defensive and negative. [gateway to the subconscious]

---------------------------------------------------------
child abuse:

Se:	you look bad, you don't give good experience, u don't care, you don't give any attention to detail

Si:	you're the most disloyal person on the planet.

Fe:	you're uncaring and the most selfish person in the world

---------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------
Unconscious:

Nemesis: worry. if I can get over my worry I can access unconscious mind. activates unconscious when someone gets over your worry. we can be forced into unconscious through nemesis. [gateway to unconscious]
Critic: what a person criticizes. and where your wisdom exists. 
trickster: unaware, being blindsided
Demon: where sin exists, parasite persona within the mind [gateway to superego] super ego wants to pull down and replace the ego.
---------------------------------------------------------
critic:
Fi: criticizing your own sense of self worth, and feel worthless.
---------------------------------------------------------
trickster:
Fi: zero moral awareness, don't make moral decisions, no ethics
---------------------------------------------------------
enlightenment: being able to use all 4 sides of mind in perfect balance:
-getting over insecurity
-getting over worry
---------------------------------------------------------
cause them to hate u: hit inferior
teach them a lesson: critic
avoid demon at all costs
trickster is not even real to them
---------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------
Temperaments:

the guardians (SJ):
 traditionalists, the most common type, past, duty, safety, protecting (justifying things cuz of protection), it's about what they should do not what they want, they're always aware of the intentions of other people, need to be told what they should do. they might be afraid of other people's intentions and get paranoid. they'll try anything. they wanna be comfy. yolo. they'll remember anything. military, firemen, the police force. if you're mot like them they might diagnose you with ADHD an autism. they don't take rusks and they'll judge you for taking risks. 

the artisans (ST):
