when the program starts in configuration in the "Hostname(IP address)" section type in the destinations IP address, (192.168.43.205 in my case)


connect to GUI by installing VNC Server on the target computer (my case: PC name: "Hashem's PC", password: "13760431hH" but the raspberry's was "pi"and"12345678") and VNC viewr( in my case for the raspberry: 192.168.43.205:5901) on your own pc.

for usb connection through putty set "Connection Type" to "Serial", and "speed" to "105200" instead of "9600" and lookup the COM port number in device manager (in my case "COM8")


if you run into problems executing commands using ssh, such as:
	cv2.error: OpenCV(4.5.3) /tmp/pip-wheel-pd499c9i/opencv-python_3a15e83eee864e65b7311a199a94e9f1/opencv/modules/highgui/src/window_gtk.cpp:635: error: (-2:Unspecified error) Can't initialize GTK backend in function 'cvInitSystem'
try these:
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install gtk
then you probably need to set up an X Server using something like Cygwin, here's the full tutorial:

	it says there that you install the app, click all, click X11, make sure to check "Xhost" and "Xterm". then open the app and type "startx"
