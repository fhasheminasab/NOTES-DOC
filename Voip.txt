using "eyebeam":

-install and open "Advanced Ip Scanner", and hit scan.
-find the Ip of the phone you want to connect to. (in my case it was 192.168.4.164)
-enter it in a browser and log in (in my case it was "admin" "admin")
-go to the account settings and grab some data:
	-Username
	-Password
	-SIP Server
(if the password is not visible right click on it and hit inspect, in its element delete the "type" field)

-download and install eyebeam, somewhere in the process you'll have to hit something like "Allow public ...".
-when you come across the "Settings-server" screen:
	-check "Enable this SIP account"
	-give it a display name
	-give it the username and password you picked up
	-in the "Domain" field, enter the "SIP Server" ip you picked up
	-hit apply and you're getting access to the phone and denying it from the original user of the phone. so remember to give the access back when you're done.
-when you're done, right click on the phone and hit settings.
-then uncheck "Enable this SIP account" and restart the phone.
